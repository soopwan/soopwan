I'm currently enrolled in the KKCF Program, where I'm just beginning my journey into tech. Right now, I'm focused on learning how to design clean and user-friendly interfaces using Figma. I haven’t started coding yet, but I’m excited to learn and grow as a developer. This is just the beginning for me — I'm here to build, create, and keep leveling up.
